# Introduction To Software Development 2
This hands-on intensive course continues on from and requires the object-oriented programming experience covered in COMP 1409. 
The language of example is Java, which is used to provide a solid foundation in current programming concepts and methodologies, 
with a focus on problem solving. Topics include: data abstraction, modularity, object-oriented programming concepts (encapsulation, 
inheritance, polymorphism), testing and debugging. Students will be prepared to understand more advanced courses in either
procedural or object-oriented programming languages.

Learning Outcomes:
<ul>
<li>Use Eclipse Development Environment</li>
<li>Demonstrate skills in problem solving.</li>
<li>Demonstrate fundamental programming skills using conditionals and iteration.</li>
<li>Demonstrate object-oriented programming skills by designing and writing Java programs that use multiple interacting classes, inheritance and polymorphism.</li>
<li>Design robust, easily-maintained programs using Java.</li>
<li>Test and debug Java programs using a variety of testing techniques.</li>
<li>Prepare program documentation.</li>
<li>Be prepared to move on to higher level OO programming languages: Java, C# and C++.</li>
</ul>
