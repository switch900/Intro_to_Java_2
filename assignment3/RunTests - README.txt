Note, I have created a testing tool for you. This compares the expected output from TestAssignment to your TestAssignment output.

Steps to run this.

1. Do your assignment :)
2. Make your assignment compile against TestAssignment3.java
3. Run RunTest.java. Your mark will be mostly based off this output.

Note that RunTest.java is not a unit test suite. This means it will not turn green in blueJ like the last one will.

Remember that I will be looking at your solution, and NOT just running this tool. ALL style rules still apply.
